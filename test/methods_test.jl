# This test file test that deserialization of method responses from Slack
# execute wihout errors.
#
# The tests are not actually present in this git repository. These tests
# come from the "Tester" tab in the Slack API pages for each method. The issue is that they
# come from actual requests done by my user, and so they contain a bunch of data which I
# might not want public, I believe including the test token provided by Slack. Therefore
# each test is located on my machine only, and is ignored by the .gitignore file.
#
# Note that these tests don't check that the deserialized fields have the correct values.
# Primarily these tests confirm those fields that are mandatory, and those that are optional.
# When creating the first of these test methods I came across many fields which are optional,
# because they're not present in the JSON response, but were marked as mandatory in our code.
# In the distant future I will add that functionality to these tests though. Each test file
# will have a companion Julia file which contains the expected deserialized object. It's
# time consuming to write tests though.
